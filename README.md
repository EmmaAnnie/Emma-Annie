I am a first year student and SAIT, and am in the Interactive Design Diploma program. My major is Web Design and Development and I am hoping to learn more about how to design and create websites that are visually pleasing. 
My goal by the end of this semester is to know all the basic features for coding and to be able to apply that knowledge to all my projects, not only for school but for my future career as well. 
My goal for when I finish my program is to use all the knowledge I have gained those past two years and further my career in web design.
